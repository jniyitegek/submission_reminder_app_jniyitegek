The app startup and running instructions:
To start the app, go to your terminal and run this command: ./create_environment.sh.
That command will start the script which will help in creating the environment for the app to run smoothly. 
Upon running ./create_environment.sh, you will be prompted to type the name under which the environment directories will be created.
Type your name, for example, Lucas_Nshuti
After the environment has been created successfully, you will be asked to choose whether you want to run the app automatically or through command. Choose accordingly: y(Yes) to start to app right away or n(No) to run the app manually. Details will be provided.
If you choose Yes, the app will automatically start, and you will receive the details about:
The assignment title and its due date.
The names of the students who didn’t submit yet.
The titles of assignments they didn’t submit.



Suppose you choose No in the previous step. You will be given a command that will navigate to your environment (remember, we created it in step one). Also, you will be given the command to type in to start the app manually. (./startup.sh). Don’t worry; all the commands will be provided, and you have to copy and paste them.
You will then get the same details as the one in the previous step but one.
